            Use this to export data in the form of a "working set", or a portion of a working set (a "slice"). A working set is simply a collection of data from the Indaba library.
            <br><br>
            To export data, you will need to select a working set from the list of options. You can export the entire set, or select a portion of the set. Exporting the entire working set is fastest. Exporting a "slice" will offer you "wizards" to help boil down the working set by indicators of interest, raw versus aggregated data, and/or tags.
            <br><br>
            If the working set you want does not exist, you will need to create it. This requires an Indaba account with permission to create a new working set. If you do not have this permission, you can only export existing working sets.
            <br><br>
            The download will contain three CSV files: "summary" containing metadata about the export;  "indicators" containing full descriptions of the questions asked; "raw" containing the answers to the questions.
